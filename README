=================================================
BEFORE RUNNING:

It is assumed that the OpenStack Nova project is installed on 
this machine, and there are instances running currently. 
ProcessMonitor is implemented through libvmi APIs. Please
ensure that libvirt is properly configured before installing 
libvmi. To check if libvirt is correctly configured, run the
following command:

# virsh list

You should see a list of running instances on current hypervisor.
If not, please solve them first!
